Preparing images
----------------

If you don't use Image service, it's possible to provide images to Bare Metal
service via a URL.

At the moment, only two types of URLs are acceptable instead of Image
service UUIDs: HTTP(S) URLs (for example, "http://my.server.net/images/img")
and file URLs (file:///images/img).

There are however some limitations for different hardware interfaces:

* If you're using :ref:`direct-deploy` with HTTP(s) URLs, you have to provide
  the Bare Metal service with the a checksum of your instance image.

  MD5 is used by default for backward compatibility reasons. To compute an MD5
  checksum, you can use the following command:

  .. code-block:: console

   $ md5sum image.qcow2
   ed82def8730f394fb85aef8a208635f6  image.qcow2

  Alternatively, use a SHA256 checksum or any other algorithm supported by
  the Python's hashlib_, e.g.:

  .. code-block:: console

   $ sha256sum image.qcow2
   9f6c942ad81690a9926ff530629fb69a82db8b8ab267e2cbd59df417c1a28060  image.qcow2

* If you're using :ref:`direct-deploy` with ``file://`` URLs, you have to
  ensure the images meet all requirements:

  * File images must be accessible to every conductor
  * File images must be located in a path listed in
    :oslo.config:option:`conductor.file_url_allowed_paths`
  * File images must not be located in ``/dev``, ``/sys``, ``/proc``,
    ``/etc``, ``/boot``, ``/run`` or other system paths starting with the
    Ironic 2025.2 release.

  .. warning::
    The Ironic CLI tool will not transfer the file from a local machine to the
    conductor(s). Operators should use shared file systems or configuration
    management to ensure consistent availability of images.

.. note::
   The Bare Metal service tracks content changes for non-Glance images by
   checking their modification date and time. For example, for HTTP image,
   if 'Last-Modified' header value from response to a HEAD request to
   "http://my.server.net/images/deploy.ramdisk" is greater than cached image
   modification time, Ironic will re-download the content. For "file://"
   images, the file system modification time is used.

   If the HTTP server does not provide the last modification date and time,
   the image will be redownloaded every time it is used.

Enrolling nodes
---------------

#. Create a node in Bare Metal service. At minimum, you must specify the driver
   name (for example, ``ipmi``). You can also specify all the required
   driver parameters in one command. This will return the node UUID:

   .. code-block:: console

    $ baremetal node create --driver ipmi \
        --driver-info ipmi_address=ipmi.server.net \
        --driver-info ipmi_username=user \
        --driver-info ipmi_password=pass \
        --driver-info deploy_kernel=file:///images/deploy.vmlinuz \
        --driver-info deploy_ramdisk=http://my.server.net/images/deploy.ramdisk

    |              | u'******'}                                                               |
    | extra        | {}                                                                       |
    | driver       | ipmi                                                                     |

    | properties   | {}                                                                       |
    +--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Note that here deploy_kernel and deploy_ramdisk contain links to
   images instead of Image service UUIDs.

#. As in case of Compute service, you can also provide ``capabilities`` to node
   properties, but they will be used only by Bare Metal service (for example,
   boot mode). Although you don't need to add properties like ``memory_mb``,
   ``cpus`` etc. as Bare Metal service will require UUID of a node you're
   going to deploy.

#. Then create a port to inform Bare Metal service of the network interface
   cards which are part of the node by creating a port with each NIC's MAC
   address. In this case, they're used for naming of PXE configs for a node:

   .. code-block:: shell

    baremetal port create $MAC_ADDRESS --node $NODE_UUID
