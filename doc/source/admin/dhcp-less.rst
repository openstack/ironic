Layer 3 or DHCP-less ramdisk booting
====================================

.. warning::
   As of the Victoria release, the ramdisk side of this feature does **NOT**
   work out-of-box because of a conflict between NetworkManager and Glean_.
   To use it properly you need to manually create a ramdisk with Glean_ taking
   priority over any other network configuration.

Booting nodes via PXE, while universally supported, suffers from one
disadvantage: it requires a direct L2 connectivity between the node and the
control plane for DHCP. Using virtual media it is possible to avoid not only
the unreliable TFTP protocol, but DHCP altogether.

When network data is provided for a node as explained below, the generated
virtual media ISO will also serve as a configdrive_, and the network data will
be stored in the standard OpenStack location.

The simple-init_ element needs to be used when creating the deployment ramdisk.
The Glean_ tool will look for a media labeled as ``config-2``. If found, the
network information from it will be read, and the node's networking stack will
be configured accordingly.

.. note::
   If desired, some interfaces can still be configured to use DHCP.

Hardware type support
---------------------

This feature is known to work with the following hardware types:

* :doc:`Redfish </admin/drivers/redfish>` with ``redfish-virtual-media`` boot
* :doc:`iLO </admin/drivers/ilo>` with ``ilo-virtual-media`` boot

Configuring network data
------------------------

When the Bare Metal service is running within OpenStack, no additional
configuration is required - the network configuration will be fetched from the
Network service.

Alternatively, the user can build and pass network configuration in form of
a network_data_ JSON to a node via the ``network_data`` field. Node-based
configuration takes precedence over the configuration generated by the
Network service and also works in standalone mode.

.. code-block:: bash

  baremetal node set --network-data ~/network_data.json <node>

An example network data:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "links": [
            {
                "id": "port-92750f6c-60a9-4897-9cd1-090c5f361e18",
                "type": "phy",
                "ethernet_mac_address": "52:54:00:d3:6a:71"
            }
        ],
        "networks": [
            {
                "id": "network0",
                "type": "ipv4",
                "link": "port-92750f6c-60a9-4897-9cd1-090c5f361e18",
                "ip_address": "192.168.122.42",
                "netmask": "255.255.255.0",
                "network_id": "network0",
                "routes": []
            }
        ],
        "services": []
    }

.. note::
   Some fields are redundant with the port information. We're looking into
   simplifying the format, but currently all these fields are mandatory.
