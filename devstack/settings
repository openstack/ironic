# which is fine, but if our MTU is lower, then that can create headaches,
# unless we *need* it lower for specific multinode testing.
# so if the calculated local_mtu *is* higher, then we are wrong, and trust
# a prepopulated variable (1500-40-30=1430 bytes)

# However, if traffic is flowing over IPv6 tunnels, then
# The overhead is essentially another 100 bytes. In order to
# handle both cases, lets go ahead and drop the maximum by
# 100 bytes.
