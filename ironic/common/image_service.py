        This method supports the caller, but is located in the image service
        code to provide it access to the Container Registry client code which
        holds the lower level methods.

        The purpose of this method is to take the user requested image_href
        and identify the best matching artifact attached to a container
        registry's entry. This is because the container registry can
        contain many artifacts which can be distributed and allocated
        by different types. To achieve this goal, this method utilizes
        the image_download_source to weight the preference of type of
        file to look for, and the CPU architecture to enable support
        for mutli-arch container registries.

        In order to inform the caller about the url, as well as related
        data, such as the manifest which points to the artifact, artifact
        digest, known original filename of the artifact, this method
        returns a dictionary with several fields which may be useful
        to aid in understanding of what artifact was chosen.

        :param image_href: The image URL as supplied by the Ironic user.
        :param image_download_source: The Ironic image_download_source
            value, defaults to None. When a value of 'local' is provided,
            this method prefers selection of qcow images over raw images.
            Otherwise, raw images are the preference.
        :param cpu_arch: The Bare Metal node's defined CPU architecture,
            if any. Defaults to None. When used, a direct match is sought
            in the remote container registry. If 'x86_64' or 'amd64' is used,
            the code searches for the values in the remote registry
            interchangeably due to OCI data model standardizing on `amd64` as
            the default value for 64bit x86 Architectures.

            selected artifact including size, filename, blob digest, related
            manifest digest, the remote recorded mediaType value, if the file
            appears compressed, if the file appears to be a raw disk image,
            any HTTP Authorization secret, if applicable, and the OCI

            different selection algorithms and evolving standards/approaches
            in use of OCI registries, the dictionary can also be empty, or
            contain different values and any caller should defensively use
            information as needed. If a record is *not* found, a empty
