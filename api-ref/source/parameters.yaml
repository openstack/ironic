# variables in query
fields:
  description: |
    One or more chassis fields to be returned in the response.

    For example, the following request returns only the ``description``
    field for each chassis:

    ::

       GET /v1/chassis?fields=description
  in: query
  required: false
  type: array
limit:
  description: |
    Requests a page size of items. Returns a number
    of items up to a limit value. Use the ``limit`` parameter to make
    an initial limited request and use the ID of the last-seen item
    from the response as the ``marker`` parameter value in a
    subsequent limited request.
  in: query
  required: false
  type: integer
marker:
  description: |
    The ID of the last-seen item. Use the ``limit``
    parameter to make an initial limited request and use the ID of the
    last-seen item from the response as the ``marker`` parameter value
    in a subsequent limited request.
  in: query
  required: false
  type: string
sort_dir:
  description: |
    Sorts the response by the requested sort
    direction. A valid value is ``asc`` (ascending) or ``desc``
    (descending). Default is ``asc``. You can specify multiple pairs
    of sort key and sort direction query parameters. If you omit the
    sort direction in a pair, the API uses the natural sorting
    direction of the server attribute that is provided as the
    ``sort_key``.
  in: query
  required: false
  type: string
sort_key:
  description: |
    Sorts the response by the this attribute value.
    Default is ``id``. You can specify multiple pairs of sort key and
    sort direction query parameters. If you omit the sort direction in
    a pair, the API uses the natural sorting direction of the server
    attribute that is provided as the ``sort_key``.
