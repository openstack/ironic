upgrade:
  - |
    The minimum required version of ``openstacksdk`` has been updated from
    ``>=0.99.0`` to ``>=4.9.0``. This version bump is required, amongst others,
    to enable secure hash validation for image downloads, which provides
    improved data integrity verification using SHA256, SHA512, and other
    secure hash algorithms instead of MD5-only validation.
security:
  - |
    Image downloads now support secure hash validation direct from the sdk
    library using SHA256, SHA512, and other secure hash algorithms via the
    ``os_hash_algo`` and ``os_hash_value`` metadata fields, instead of
    Ironic having to perform these checks outside of sdk code.
