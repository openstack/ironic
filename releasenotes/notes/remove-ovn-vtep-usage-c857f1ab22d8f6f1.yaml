    Ironic is deprecating and immediately removing the capability to pass
    OVN VTEP connection information across through to Neutron. Over the
    past year, multiple contributors have looked into this alpha level
    functionality which was merged into Ironic and it was realized that
    the functionality was geared for the OVN VTEP port service which is
    a separate service one must launch on a OVN networking node to make
    an attachment.

    Since the functionality which was merged into ironic is unsuitable for
    scaled and automated operations it must be removed. API field
    validation is being kept, and the API version has bee incremented to
    ``1.104`` to signify this change, however the passing on Neutron
    Port Binding has been removed.

    Ironic developers are actively working on a performant solution
    in the short term. We hope to have something else usable before the
    2026.1 release.
