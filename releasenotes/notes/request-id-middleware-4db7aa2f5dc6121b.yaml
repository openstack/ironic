    Ironic API now returns the ``X-OpenStack-Request-Id`` header, which is
    the common response header to return request id in multiple OpenStack
    projects. The header mirrors the existing ``OpenStack-Request-Id`` header.
    If ironic API supports microversion 1.107, ironic returns the new header.
