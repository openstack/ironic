    The anaconda deploy interface was saving internal information in
    the node's instance_info, in the user-facing 'stage2' and
    'ks_template' fields. This broke rebuilds using a different image
    with different stage2 or template specified in the image properties.
    This has been fixed by saving the information in the node's
    driver_internal_info instead.
