    The lookup API now includes an ``agent_skip_bmc_detect`` configuration
    flag that is automatically set to True when nodes use out-of-band
    management interfaces (Redfish, iDRAC Redfish, iLO, iRMC). This tells
    the agent to skip BMC detection via ipmitool, reducing deployment
    time and avoiding unnecessary ipmitool calls when the BMC address is
    already configured in Ironic.
