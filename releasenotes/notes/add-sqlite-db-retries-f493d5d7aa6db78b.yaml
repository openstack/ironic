    Adds a database write retry decorate for SQLite failures reporting
    "database is locked". By default, through the new configuration
    parameter ``[database]sqlite_max_wait_for_retry``, retries will
    be performed on failing write operations for up to *30* seconds.

    This value can be tuned, but be warned it is an expotential
    backoff retry model, and HTTP requests can give up if no
    response is received in a reasonable time, thus *30* seconds
    was deemed a reasonable default.

    The retry logic can be disabled using the
    ``[database]sqlite_retries`` option, which defaults to
    *True*. Users of other, mutli-threaded/concurrent-write database
    platforms are not impacted by this change, as the retry logic
    recognizes if another database is in use and bypasses the retry
    logic in that case. A similar retry logic concept already exists
    with other databases in the form of a "Database Deadlock" retry
    where two writers conflict on the same row or table. The database
    abstraction layer already handles such deadlock conditions.
    The SQLite file based locking issue is unfortunately more common
    with file based write locking as the entire file, in other words
    the entire database, to perform the write operation.
