    When a conductor service is stopped it will now continue to respond to RPC
    requests until ``[DEFAULT]hash_ring_reset_interval`` has elapsed, allowing
    a hash ring reset to complete on the cluster after conductor is
    unregistered. This will improve the reliability of the cluster when scaling
    down or rolling out updates.

    This delay only occurs when there is more than one online conductor,
    to allow fast restarts on single-node ironic installs (bifrost,
    metal3).
