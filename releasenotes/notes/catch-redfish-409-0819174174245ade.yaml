    Fixes a race condition where the Redfish power interface could fail with
    HTTP 400 (BadRequest) or HTTP 409 (Conflict) errors during power
    operations. These errors are now treated as success when the node is
    already in the target power state (either on or off), preventing
    deployment failures when power state changes complete after Ironic's
    state verification times out.
    Also refresh system state to get current power state from BMC
    instead of using potentially stale cached data.
