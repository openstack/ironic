    Fixes Redfish RAID volume creation failure when size_gb='MAX' is
    specified. Ironic now omits CapacityBytes from the Redfish payload
    for MAX size volumes, allowing the controller to calculate the
    optimal size accounting for metadata overhead. The actual volume
    size is queried and stored after creation.
