    The ``ipa-inspection-callback-url`` kernel parameter now uses the
    ``external_callback_url`` configuration when set. Previously, this
    URL used the internal address even when ``external_callback_url``
    was configured, creating inconsistency with ``ipa-api-url`` which
    correctly used the external address.
