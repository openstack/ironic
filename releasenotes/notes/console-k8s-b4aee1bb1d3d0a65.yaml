    A new ``ironic.console.container`` provider is added called ``kubernetes``
    which allows Ironic conductor to manage console containers as Kubernetes
    pods. The kubernetes resources are defined in the template file
    configured by ``[vnc]kubernetes_container_template`` and the default
    template creates one secret to store the app info, and one pod to run
    the console container.

    It is expected that Ironic conductor is deployed inside the kubernetes
    cluster. The associated service account will need roles and bindings which
    allow it to manage the required resources (with the default template this
    will be secrets and pods).

    This provider holds the assumption that ironic-novnc will be deployed
    in the same kubernetes cluster, and so can connect to the VNC servers
    via the pod's ``status.hostIP``.
