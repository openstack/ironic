    The ``bootc`` deploy interface is now enabled by default in
    ``enabled_deploy_interfaces`` and has also been added to the default list
    of ``autodetect_deploy_interfaces`` for the ``autodetect`` deploy
    interface. This allows nodes configured with the ``autodetect`` deploy
    interface to automatically select the ``bootc`` deploy interface for
    container images which are identified as bootc images through registry
    introspection. The ``autodetect`` deploy interface will fall back to the
    ``direct`` deploy interface for standard disk images and OCI artifacts.
