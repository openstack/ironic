    Currently ironic allows entering deployment or cleaning for nodes in
    maintenance mode. However, heartbeats do not cause any actions for such
    nodes, thus deployment or cleaning never finish if the nodes are not moved
    out of maintenance. A new configuration option
    ``[conductor]allow_provisioning_in_maintenance`` (defaulting to ``True``)
    is added to configure this behavior. If it is set to ``False``, deployment
    and cleaning will be prevented from nodes in maintenance mode.
