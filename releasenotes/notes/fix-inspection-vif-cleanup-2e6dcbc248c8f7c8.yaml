    Fixes an issue where baremetal nodes that experienced inspection errors,
    either through timeout or hard failure, were not having their inspection
    VIFs (Virtual Interfaces) removed from the node's ports. This resulted in
    network resource leaks that persisted after the node transitioned to the
    ``inspect fail`` state.

    The inspection error handling now properly cleans up inspection networks
    by calling ``remove_inspection_network()`` on all error paths, matching
    the behavior of cleaning, servicing, and deployment error handlers. This
    ensures that inspection VIFs are always removed from ports when inspection
    fails, preventing network resource leaks.
