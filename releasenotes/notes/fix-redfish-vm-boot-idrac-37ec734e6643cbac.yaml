    Fixes ``redfish-virtual-media`` ``boot`` interface to allow it with
    iDRAC firmware from 6.00.00.00 (released June 2022) as it
    has virtual media boot issue fixed that prevented iDRAC firmware to
    work with ``redfish-virtual-media`` before. Consider upgrading iDRAC
    firmware if not done already, otherwise will still get an error
    when trying to use ``redfish-virtual-media`` with iDRAC.
