    Resolved clear_job_queue and reset_idrac verify step failures which occur
    when the functionality is not supported by the iDRAC. When this condition
    is detected, the code in the step handles the exception and logs a warning
    and completes successfully in case of verification steps but fails in case
    of cleaning steps.
