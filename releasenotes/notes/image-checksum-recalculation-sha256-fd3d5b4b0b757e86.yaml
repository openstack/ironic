    If ``[DEFAULT]force_raw_images`` is set to ``true``, then MD5 will not be
    utilized to recalculate the image checksum. This requires the
    ``ironic-python-agent`` ramdisk to be at least version 3.4.0.

    Image checksum recalculation when images are forced to raw images, are now
    calculated using SHA3-256 if MD5 was selected. This is now unconditional.
