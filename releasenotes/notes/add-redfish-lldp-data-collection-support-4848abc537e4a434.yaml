    Adds Redfish LLDP data collection support to the Redfish inspection interface.
    This enables collecting Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) data from
    Redfish-compliant hardware during the inspection process. The collected
    data includes chassis ID, port ID, system name, system description,
    system capabilities, and management addresses, formatted as TLVs
    compatible with Ironic Python Agent inspection hooks and rules.
