    The container build recipe for the graphical console container image has
    replaced the Chrome/Selenium approach with a Firefox extension.

    The previous containerised graphical console approach had a Selenium
    script managing a Chrome browser session. This change replaces that with
    firefox and a custom extension to perform the required actions to login
    and load the BMC console. This supports the same vendors as the previous
    approach (iDRAC, iLO, Supermicro).

    Functional differences with the chrome/selenium version:

    * Firefox kiosk mode has a more locked-down environment, including
      disabling context menus. This means the brittle workaround to disable
      them is no longer required.
    * Firefox global policy allows the environment to be locked down
      further, including limiting accessing to all URLs except the BMC.
    * There is now a dedicated loading page which can show status updates
      until the first BMC page loads. This page shows error messages if any
      of the early redfish calls fail.
    * VNC client sessions are now shared with multiple clients, and firefox
      will be started on the first connection, and stopped when the last
      connection ends.
    * Starting Xvfb is now deferred until the first VNC client connection.
      This results in a never-connected container using 5MB vs 30MB
      once Xvfb is started. Starting Xvfb has ~1sec time penalty on first
      connection.
    * The browser now runs in a dedicated non-root user
    * All redfish consoles now hide toolbar elements with a CSS overlay rather than
      simulating other methods such as clicking the "Full Screen" button.
    * ilo6/ilo5 detection is now done by a redfish call and the ilo5 path
      has less moving parts.
