    The deprecated ``inspector`` inspect interface has been removed. Use
    the ``agent`` interface instead.

    See `migration guide
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/inspection/migration.html>`_
    to learn how existing deployments with ironic-inspector can be migrated to
    a new architecture with the built-in inspection feature.
