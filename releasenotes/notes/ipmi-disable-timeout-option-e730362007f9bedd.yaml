    Adds a configuration option ``[ipmi]disable_boot_timeout`` which is used
    to set the default behavior whether ironic should send a raw IPMI command
    to disable timeout. This configuration option can be overridden by the
    per-node option ``ipmi_disable_boot_timeout`` in node's ``driver_info``
    field.
