    Adds a new standalone networking service that enables Ironic to manage
    physical network switch configurations for bare metal nodes without
    requiring Neutron. This service can run independently of the main Ironic
    conductor, providing network switch management capabilities.

    This feature is particularly useful for deployments where Neutron is not
    available or where network switch management needs to be isolated from the
    main conductor service for scalability or security reasons. The
    ironic-networking interface is marked as experimental to allow for
    feedback and iteration before becoming a stable interface.
