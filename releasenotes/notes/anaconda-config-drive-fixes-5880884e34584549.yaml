fixes:
  - |
    The anaconda deploy interface was treating the config drive
    as a dict, whereas it could be a dict or in iso6600 format,
    gzipped and base64-encoded. This has been fixed.
  - |
    The anaconda deploy interface was adding commands that deal with the
    config drive, to the end of the kickstart config file. Which means
    that they are handled after an ironic API request is sent (to the
    conductor) to indicate that the node has been provisioned and is
    ready to be rebooted. Which means that there is a possible race condition
    wrt these commands being completed before the node is powered off.
    A sync is added to ensure that all modifications have been written
    to disk, before the API request is sent -- as the last thing.
  - |
    Extra newlines ('\n') were incorrectly added to the user data content.
    This broke the content-type decoding and cloud-init was unable to
    process them. The extra newlines have been removed.
