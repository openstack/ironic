    Adds a new ``instance_name`` field to Ironic nodes. This field can be used
    to store the display name of the Nova instance that is associated with the
    node, matching the constraints and format of Nova's ``display_name`` field.
    The field supports strings up to 255 characters with minimum length of 1
    character when not null.

    The ``instance_name`` field is automatically cleared when instance data
    is cleared during node teardown operations. For forward compatibility,
    when Nova or other API clients update ``instance_info`` with a
    ``display_name`` value, that value is automatically copied to the
    ``instance_name`` field if ``instance_name`` is not explicitly being set
    in the same request.
