    The Fujitsu ``irmc`` hardware type has been deprecated for removal in a
    future Ironic release. The Third Party CI for the driver stopped
    responding on or around July 7th, 2019, and attempts to contact the
    vendor have been unsuccessful. As such, we cannot claim fixes or changes
    to the driver are in a working state.

    Users of the ``irmc`` hardware type should begin planning migration to
    alternative hardware types. All iRMC-specific interfaces (``irmc`` bios,
    ``irmc-virtual-media`` and ``irmc-pxe`` boot, ``irmc`` inspect, ``irmc``
    management, ``irmc`` power, and ``irmc`` raid interfaces) are now marked
    as unsupported, and all configuration options in the ``[irmc]`` section
    have been deprecated for removal.

    The ``irmc`` hardware type and all associated interfaces and configuration
    options will be removed in a future release.
