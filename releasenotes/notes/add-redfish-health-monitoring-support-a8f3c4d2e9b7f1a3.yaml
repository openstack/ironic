    Adds hardware health status monitoring and synchronization capability.
    A new ``health`` field has been added to the Node object and API
    (microversion 1.109) to expose hardware health status reported by the
    BMC.

    This feature introduces a new optional ``get_node_health()`` method in
    the management interface. Drivers can implement this method to retrieve
    health status from the BMC. During periodic power state synchronization,
    Ironic automatically calls this method for all nodes. Drivers that don't
    support health monitoring simply raise ``UnsupportedDriverExtension``
    and are skipped. When health status changes, it is automatically saved
    to the node record and logged in the node history.

    The Redfish management interface (including ``idrac-redfish``) provides
    the first implementation, retrieving health status from the Redfish
    System resource (``Status.Health`` field). Values include ``OK``,
    ``Warning``, and ``Critical``. Operators can monitor this field to
    detect hardware issues proactively.

    Other driver implementations (iLO, iRMC, etc.) can add support by
    implementing the ``get_node_health()`` method in their management
    interface.

    The feature is enabled by default but can be disabled using the
    ``[conductor]/enable_health_monitoring`` configuration option. When
    disabled, health status queries are not performed, and the node.health
    field will not be updated automatically. Drivers opt-in to health
    monitoring by implementing the ``get_node_health()`` interface method.
