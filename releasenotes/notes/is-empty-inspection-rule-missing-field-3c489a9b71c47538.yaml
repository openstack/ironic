    Fixes the ``is-empty`` inspection rule to properly handle missing fields
    in the inventory. Previously, when checking for empty values using fields
    that don't exist in the inventory, the rule would fail with a KeyError
    during variable interpolation. Now, missing fields are treated as empty
    for the ``is-empty`` operation, allowing the rule to pass when checking
    for non-existent inventory fields.
