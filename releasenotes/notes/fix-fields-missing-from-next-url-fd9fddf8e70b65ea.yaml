    Fixes issue where the resource list API returned results with requested
    fields only until the API MAX_LIMIT. After the API MAX_LIMIT is reached the
    API started ignoring user requested fields. This fix will make sure that
    the next url generated by the pagination code will include the user
    requested fields as query parameter.
