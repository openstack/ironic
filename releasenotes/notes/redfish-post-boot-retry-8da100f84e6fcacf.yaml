    Adds retry logic for Redfish boot device changes when BMC rejects
    modifications during POST (Power-On Self-Test). This addresses issues
    with HPE iLO BMCs returning ``UnableToModifyDuringSystemPOST`` errors
    after firmware updates or reboots. See bug
    `2136275 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/2136275>`_.
