    The tempest plugin code that was in ``ironic_tempest_plugin/`` has been
    removed.  Tempest plugin code has been migrated to the project
    `openstack/ironic-tempest-plugin
    <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/ironic-tempest-plugin>`_. This
    was an OpenStack wide `goal for the Queens cycle
    <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/goals/queens/split-tempest-plugins.html>`_.
