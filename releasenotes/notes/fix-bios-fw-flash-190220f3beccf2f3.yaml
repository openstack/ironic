    Fixes an issue with BIOS firmware updates on certain BMCs where the
    firmware task completes very quickly after staging the firmware,
    before Ironic can trigger a reboot. Previously, this would result in the
    staged BIOS firmware not being applied because no reboot was triggered.
    Now, Ironic detects this condition and triggers the reboot when the task
    completes, ensuring the staged firmware is properly applied.
