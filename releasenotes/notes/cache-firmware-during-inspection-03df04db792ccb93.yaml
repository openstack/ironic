    Fixes a bug where newly added baremetal hosts won't contain the NIC
    firmware information. Some hardware only returns NetworkAdapters information
    when the node is powered on, but firmware caching previously only occurred
    during cleaning or servicing phases, which could be skipped or happen after
    the node is powered off.
