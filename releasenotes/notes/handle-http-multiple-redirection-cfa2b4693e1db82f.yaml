    Fixed HttpImageService.validate_href() ImageRefValidationFailed exception
    if protocol is HTTP/HTTPS and the HTTP header response is a redirection
    other then 301 (MOVED_PERMANENTLY). HTTP/HTTPS protocol is often used
    under standalone Ironic configuration to identify an image source (e.g
    --instance-info image_source=<URI>). The HTTP server may use redirection
    to load balance or geographically distribute the requests, or simply point
    to the correct URL. The redirection may vary from 301 (MOVED_PERMANENTLY),
    to 302 (FOUND), or 307 (TEMPORARY_REDIRECT), and 308 (PERMANENT_REDIRECT).
