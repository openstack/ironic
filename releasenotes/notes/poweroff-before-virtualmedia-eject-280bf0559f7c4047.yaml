    Fixes a bug where virtual media was ejected before the graceful shutdown
    was issued during the inspection teardown phase. This caused filesystem
    corruption errors on nodes (particularly visible on iDRAC consoles) when
    the operating system lost access to its boot media during shutdown. The fix
    ensures that a soft power off is performed before ejecting virtual media,
    allowing the OS to shut down cleanly before the virtual media is ejected.
