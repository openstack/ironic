    Fixes the ``redfish`` hardware type RAID device creation and deletion when
    creating or deleting more than 1 logical disk on RAID controllers that
    require rebooting and do not allow more than 1 running task per RAID
    controller. Before this fix 2nd logical disk would fail to be created or
    deleted. With this change it is now possible to use ``redfish`` ``raid``
    interface on iDRAC systems.
