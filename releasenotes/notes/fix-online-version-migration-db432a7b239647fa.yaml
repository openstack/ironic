    Fixes an issue in the online upgrade logic where database models for
    Node Traits and BIOS Settings resulted in an error when performing
    the online data migration. This was because these tables were originally
    created as extensions of the Nodes database table, and the schema
    of the database was slightly different enough to result in an error
    if there was data to migrate in these tables upon upgrade,
    which would have occured if an early BIOS Setting adopter had
    data in the database prior to upgrading to the Yoga release of Ironic.

    The online upgrade parameter now subsitutes an alternate primary key name
    name when applicable.
