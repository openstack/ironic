    Fixes an issue with the redfish firmware updates attached to the
    ``management`` interface where firmware updates performed as part of the
    SERVICE steps workflow could end up stuck in ``service wait``.
    This issue has been corrected and the nodes should now properly have their
    state checked. For more information, please consult
    `bug 2136895 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/2136895>`_.
