    Fixed an issue in the Redfish management driver where boot device setting
    failed for vendors requiring full boot parameter requests (such as American
    Megatrends International, ASRock Rack, and Redfish compatible systems). The
    driver was incorrectly using a parameter that could be None, but
    these vendors require explicit values for all boot parameters. This fix ensures
    that vendors in ``VENDORS_REQUIRING_FULL_BOOT_REQUEST`` always receive
    explicit boot configuration values, resolving boot device configuration
    failures on affected systems.
