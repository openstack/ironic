    Fixes excessive logging of JSON-RPC transactions by reducing the logging
    of these transactions to the minimally needful, the request ID value.
    This behavior can be disabled, and the prior pattern of verbose logging can
    be enabled by setting ``[json_rpc]debug_log_request_id_only`` to False.
