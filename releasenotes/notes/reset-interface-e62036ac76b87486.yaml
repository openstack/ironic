    Starting with API version 1.45, PATCH requests to ``/v1/nodes/<NODE>``
    accept the new query parameter ``reset_interfaces``. It can be provided
    whenever the ``driver`` field is updated. If set to 'true', all hardware
    interfaces will be reset to their defaults, except for ones updated in the
    same request.
