    Fixes OSSA-2025-001, where Ironic did not properly filter file:// paths
    when used as image sources. This would permit any file accessible by the
    conductor to be used as an image to attempt deployment. Ironic now
    unconditionally forbids paths that provide access to system
    configuration (/dev, /sys, /proc, /boot, /run, and /etc).

    Adds ``CONF.conductor.file_url_allowed_paths``, an allowlist configuration
    defaulting to ``/var/lib/ironic``, ``/shared/html``,
    ``/opt/cache/files``, ``/vagrant``, and  ``/templates``,
    permits operators to further restrict where the conductor will fetch
    images for when provided a file:// URL. This default value was chosen
    based on known usage by projects downstream of Ironic, including Metal3,
    Bifrost, and OpenShift. These defaults may change to be more restrictive
    at a later date. Operators using file:// URLs are encouraged to explicitly
    set this value even if the current default is sufficient. Operators wishing
    to fully disable the ability to deploy with a file:// URL should set this
    configuration to "" (empty).

    This issue only poses a significant security risk when Ironic's
    automated cleaning process is disabled and the service is configured in
    such a way that permits direct deployment by an untrusted API user, such as
    standalone Ironic installations or environments granting ownership of nodes
    to projects.
