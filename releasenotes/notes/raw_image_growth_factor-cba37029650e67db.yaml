    Adds the `[DEFAULT]raw_image_growth_factor` configuration option which
    is a scale factor used for estimating the size of a raw image converted
    from compact image formats such as QCOW2. By default this is set to 2.0.

    When clearing the cache to make space for a converted raw image, the full
    virtual size is attempted first, and if not enough space is available a
    second attempt is made with the (smaller) estimated size.
