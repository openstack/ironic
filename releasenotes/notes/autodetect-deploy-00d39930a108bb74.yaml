    Adds a new ``autodetect`` deploy interface that automatically selects
    the appropriate concrete deploy interface based on image metadata and
    node configuration. This simplifies node configuration by eliminating
    the need to manually specify different deploy interfaces for different
    image types.

    The autodetect interface inspects the deployment at the beginning of the
    deployment and switches to the most appropriate deploy interface from the
    configured list in ``autodetect_deploy_interfaces``.
    The detection logic checks interfaces in priority order, so if
    ``autodetect_deploy_interfaces`` is set to ``['bootc', 'direct']``:

    - ``bootc`` Selected for OCI container images (oci:// URLs) that are
      identified as bootc images through container introspection
    - ``direct`` Fallback for standard disk images and OCI artifacts

    The autodetect interface is now enabled by default in
    ``enabled_deploy_interfaces``. A new configuration option
    ``autodetect_deploy_interfaces`` (default: ``['direct']``)
    controls which interfaces can be auto-selected and their priority order.

    The original deploy interface is preserved in driver_internal_info
    and automatically restored when exiting the ``cleaning`` state.
