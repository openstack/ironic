    Adds support for specifying vendor_data when building config drives.
    Starting with API version 1.59, a JSON based ``configdrive`` parameter to
    ``/v1/nodes/<node>/states/provision`` can include the key vendor_data.
    This data will be built into the configdrive contents as
    vendor_data2.json.
