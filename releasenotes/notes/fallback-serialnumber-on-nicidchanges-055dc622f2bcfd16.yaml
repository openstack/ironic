    Fixes a bug on where NetworkAdapters Id changes across system
    reboots, this causes firmware updates to lose the versions as IDs changes,
    duplicate database entries for same NIC.
    Now we use SerialNumber as the main source to identify the NetworkAdpter,
    we fallback to Id in case the SerialNumber is not present.
