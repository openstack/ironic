    Fixes an issue with agent startup where the workflow from the first
    agent heartbeat interaction could fail due to a transient networking
    issue leaving the Agent and Ironic in a state where the node cannot be
    deployed and continues to record errors upon each additional heartbeat
    operation. Logic to check the state of the agent has been adjusted to
    ignore retry operations which were recorded by the agent.
