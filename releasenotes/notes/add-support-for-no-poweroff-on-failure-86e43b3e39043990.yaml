features:
  - Operators can now set
    deploy.power_off_after_deploy_failure to leave nodes
    powered on when a deployment fails. This is useful
    for troubleshooting deployment issues. As a note,
    Nova will still attempt to delete a node after a failed
    deployment, so deploy.power_off_after_deploy_failure
    may not be very effective in non-standalone
    deployments until a similar patch to ironic's driver in
    nova is proposed.
