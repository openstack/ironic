    Adds a ``noop`` deploy interface that performs no actual deployment
    operations. This allows operators to allocate nodes and mark them as
    ``active`` in Ironic without deploying an operating system. This provides
    an alternative approach to node adoption for Nova deployments, where the
    normal deploy verb can be used instead of the adopt verb.
    It is also useful when nodes are managed by external systems but tracked
    in Ironic's inventory.
