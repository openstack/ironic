    The ``ironic-dbsync upgrade`` command for this verison of ironic will add
    additional database indexes on the ``nodes`` table columns below.
    Depending on database size and complexity, this will take time to complete
    for every single index to be created. On MySQL or MariaDB, these indexes
    will only be created if an index does not already exist matching the
    field name with "_idx"
    appended.:

    * ``owner``
    * ``lessee``
    * ``driver``
    * ``provision_state``
    * ``reservation``
    * ``conductor_group``
    * ``resource_class``

    An example of the SQL commands to generate these indexes can be found
    in the `tuning <htts://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/tuning.html>`_
    documentation.

    In testing with mock data, each column took approximately about 4 seconds
    per column to be indexed on a database with 115,000 rows. The existing
    database size, and underlying server load will casue this time to vary.
    Sample queries also reduced result generation from an average of ``0.40``
    seconds to an average of ``0.02`` seconds with a test data set.

    Improves lower level performance issues with database activity where some
    often queried columns were not indexed when the database model was created,
    or as the model evolved. Operators seeking to pre-create these indexes may
    do so prior to upgrading. Please consult the
    `tuning`_ documentation in the Administrator's guide for the queries to leverage.
