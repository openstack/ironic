    The Ironic team hereby announces the release of OpenStack 2023.1
    (Ironic 23.4.0). This repesents the completion of a six month development
    cycle, which primarily focused on internal and scaling improvements.
    Those improvements included revamping the database layer to improve
    performance and ensure compatability with new versions of SQLAlchemy,
    enhancing the ironic-conductor service to export application metrics to
    prometheus via the ironic-prometheus-exporter, and the addition of a
    new API concept of node sharding to help with scaling of services that
    make frequent API calls to Ironic.

    The new Ironic release also comes with a slew of bugfixes for Ironic
    services and hardware drivers. We sincerely hope you enjoy it!
