    Fixes excessive logging when Redfish-managed servers do not have
    NetworkAdapters endpoints. Previously, servers without NetworkAdapters
    would generate warning-level log messages during firmware component
    caching. Now these messages are logged at debug level since having no
    NetworkAdapters is a valid hardware configuration.
