fixes:
  - |
    Fixes an issue where image information retrieval would fail when a
    path was supplied when using the ``anaconda`` deploy interface,
    as `HTTP` ``HEAD`` requests on a URL path have no ``Content-Length``.
    We now consider if a path is used prior to attempting to collect
    additional configuration data from what is normally expected to
    be Glance.
  - |
    Fixes an issue where the fallback to a default kickstart template
    value would result in error indicating
    "Scheme-less image href is not a UUID".
    This was becaues the handling code falling back to the default
    did not explicitly indicate it was a file URL before saving the
    value.
