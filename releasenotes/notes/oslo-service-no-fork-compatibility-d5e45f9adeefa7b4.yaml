    Fixes compatibility with oslo.service versions 4.4.0 and later. The
    combined Ironic service (``ironic`` command) was passing the ``no_fork``
    parameter to ``ServiceLauncher``, which worked in oslo.service <= 4.3.0
    because ``ServiceLauncher`` was mapped to ``ProcessLauncher`` (which
    supports ``no_fork``). In oslo.service 4.4.0, this mapping was changed
    and ``ServiceLauncher`` became a distinct class that doesn't accept
    ``no_fork``, causing ``TypeError`` when starting the service. The code
    now directly uses ``ProcessLauncher`` via ``process_launcher()``, which
    properly supports ``no_fork`` and ensures VNC signal handling works
    correctly when ``[vnc]enabled=True``.
