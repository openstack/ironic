    Adds a new configuration option ``[conductor]max_concurrent_per_conductor_group``
    which, when set to ``True``, causes the ``[conductor]max_concurrent_deploy``
    and ``[conductor]max_concurrent_clean`` limits to be applied per conductor
    group instead of globally across the entire Ironic deployment. This allows
    operators with multiple conductor groups to have independent concurrency
    limits for each group, enabling better resource isolation and control
    in multi-tenant or segmented deployments.
