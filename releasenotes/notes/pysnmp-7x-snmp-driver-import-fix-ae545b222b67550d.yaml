    Avoid import-time ``AttributeError`` when PySNMP 6.2+/7.x is present. In
    those versions the legacy ``pysnmp.hlapi`` protocol constants (e.g.
    ``usmHMACMD5AuthProtocol``) were removed, which previously caused unit
    test discovery and SNMP driver import to fail. The SNMP driver now builds
    protocol mappings using ``getattr()`` fallbacks so the module imports
    without raising. Runtime still requires a PySNMP version that provides the
    legacy hlapi (e.g. 5.x). See bug #2139557
